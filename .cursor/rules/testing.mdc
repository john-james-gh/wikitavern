Use Vitest for unit and  tests. Do not use Jest.

Use Playwright for E2E tests. Cypress is not supported.

Tests must live next to the code they cover (*.test.tsx). Avoid __tests__ folders.

Keep tests minimal, fast, and focused. Mock external services.

Use @testing-library/user-event package. Don't use fireEvent.
