Prefer Next.js App Router with SSR and Server Components. Use Client Components only when necessary (e.g. for interactivity). Don’t force SSR if it complicates the codebase.

Comment non-obvious logic and edge cases. Write as if someone new to the project will read your code next week.

Log meaningful events or errors — not noise. Avoid over-logging or console spam. Use structured logging (e.g. console.error, console.info) where appropriate.

Use default export for Next.js pages. Use named exports for all other components, hooks, and utilities.
