Use shadcn/ui components where available. Avoid building UIs from scratch unless justified.

To add shadcn/ui components (e.g. button) to apps/web app, run the following command from the monorepo root.

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button -c apps/web
```

Stick to Tailwind CSS v4 utility classes. Avoid custom SCSS or external UI kits.
