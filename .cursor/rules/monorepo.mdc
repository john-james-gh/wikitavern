Use pnpm workspaces to manage dependencies. Do not use npm link, yarn workspaces, or local file: links.

Cross-package imports must use @workspace/* imports.

Use Unix-style CLI commands (Linux/macOS). Do not include or rely on Windows-only commands or paths (e.g., dir, .bat, C:\\). Scripts must run in Unix-like shells (e.g., Bash, Zsh).

When adding new dependencies, install them in the specific package or app that uses them.
Do not install shared or unrelated deps in the root package.json.
This repo follows the Turborepo-style scoped dependency model.
