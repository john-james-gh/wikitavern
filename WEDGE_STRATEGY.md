# 🚩 The Wedge Strategy: How to Crack the Fandom Monopoly

## 🧱 Rule #1: Don’t Try to Boil the Ocean

❌ **DO NOT** start by saying,

> “We’re going to replace Fandom entirely.”

✅ **DO** pick **one franchise or niche first** — and do it better than Fandom ever could.

**Think:**

> _“We are the Alien Wiki… but clean, fast, ad-free, and fan-powered.”_  
> _Or: “We are the home of Fallout lore — built for fans, not for clicks.”_

---

## 🥇 Wedge Idea Example: “Project One Franchise”

**Pick a franchise with:**

- A passionate fanbase
- A disgustingly bad Fandom experience
- Active content contributors

**Then:**

- Build **migration tooling** (more on this below).
- Give contributors a reason to jump ship:
  - ✅ Markdown editing (so they can copy/paste out anytime).
  - ✅ Custom theming.
  - ✅ No ad bloat.
  - ✅ Optional donations.

## 🧩 How You Compete (Feature by Feature)

| **Pain Point on Fandom**        | **What You Offer**                               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Bloated, ad-riddled pages       | Clean, ad-free by default (donation-supported)   |
| Clunky editing (WYSIWYG trash)  | Markdown / MDX editing + live preview            |
| Terrible search                 | Fast, fuzzy search with tag/category filters     |
| No ownership, no portability    | Contributor owns their content, optional exports |
| Forced into one ugly UI         | Themable pages, franchise identity respected     |
| Garbage mobile experience       | Mobile-first, fast load, responsive              |
| Poor version control / no diffs | Git-like history of changes, easy rollback       |

## 🛠️ Bonus: The Killer Feature = “Migration Tooling”

- Build an **import tool** that:
  - Takes Fandom wiki dumps (or lets users copy content manually).
  - Converts to Markdown + your schema.
  - Preserves page structure, categories, and metadata.

⚠️ _You could even semi-automate this with web scrapers + sanitization for public pages (depending on the legal fine print)._  
💡 _Fandom provides XML dumps for some wikis (not always willingly), so there’s a technical angle here._

---

## ⚡ How You Sell It to Editors/Contributors (The People Who Matter)

> **“Hey — are you tired of fighting Fandom’s WYSIWYG editor?  
> Want to write your wiki pages in Markdown and actually own your content?  
> We’re building the clean alternative, and you can export your work any time.”**

✅ This framing **turns their pain into your value proposition.**

---

## 🏆 Monetization Without the Rage

- ✅ Donations / supporter tiers (Patreon model).
- ✅ Optional premium features (theme customization, vanity URLs).
- ✅ Reader-supported site → no spammy display ads.
- ✅ “Sponsor a franchise” → let communities fund their own hosting.

> **The key is: DO NOT act like Fandom (Google Ads spam everywhere).**

## 🚀 Phase 1 Gameplan (First 3 Months)

| **Step**                                                  | **Outcome**                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Pick one franchise to seed                                | Focused audience, better chance of success |
| Build MVP wiki with Sanity + Next.js (or stack of choice) | Fast, clean, modern experience             |
| Import a small set of initial pages (manually if needed)  | Prove concept, early content               |
| Offer export + migration tooling (even basic)             | Signal “we don’t lock you in”              |
| Open contributor invite system                            | Seed early editor base                     |
| Enable donations / Patreon-style support                  | Validate funding model early               |

## 🥩 Optional Expansion

- Let contributors create **new wikis for other franchises** once the first community is happy.
- Offer **federation-style navigation**:
  > _“Jump from Alien to Predator to Fallout seamlessly.”_
