🚩 The Wedge Strategy: How to Crack the Fandom Monopoly
🧱 Rule #1: Don’t Try to Boil the Ocean.
DO NOT start by saying, “We’re going to replace Fandom entirely.”

DO pick one franchise or niche first and do it better than Fandom ever could.

Think:

“We are the Alien Wiki… but clean, fast, ad-free, and fan-powered.”
Or “We are the home of Fallout lore — built for fans, not for clicks.”

🥇 Wedge Idea Example: “Project One Franchise”
Pick a franchise with:

A passionate fanbase

A disgustingly bad Fandom experience

Active content contributors

Build migration tooling (more on this below).

Give contributors a reason to jump ship:

Markdown editing (so they can copy/paste out if they ever want).

Custom theming.

No ad bloat.

Optional donations.

🧩 How You Compete (Feature by Feature):

Pain Point on Fandom	What You Offer
Bloated, ad-riddled pages	Clean, ad-free by default (donation-supported)
Clunky editing (WYSIWYG trash)	Markdown / MDX editing + live preview
Terrible search	Fast, fuzzy search with tag/category filters
No ownership, no portability	Contributor owns their content, optional exports
Forced into one ugly UI	Themable pages, franchise identity respected
Garbage mobile experience	Mobile-first, fast load, responsive
Poor version control / no diffs	Git-like history of changes, easy rollback
🛠️ Bonus: The Killer Feature = “Migration Tooling”
Build an import tool that:

Takes Fandom wiki dumps (or lets users copy content manually).

Converts to Markdown + your schema.

Preserves page structure, categories, and metadata.

You could even semi-automate this with web scrapers + sanitization for public pages (depending on the legal fine print).

Fandom provides XML dumps for some wikis (not always willingly), so there’s a technical angle here.

⚡ How You Sell It to Editors/Contributors (the people who matter):
“Hey — are you tired of fighting Fandom’s WYSIWYG editor?
Want to write your wiki pages in Markdown and actually own your content?
We’re building the clean alternative, and you can export your work any time.”

This framing turns their pain into your value proposition.

🏆 Monetization Without the Rage:
Donations / supporter tiers (Patreon model).

Optional premium features (theme customization, vanity URLs).

Reader-supported site → no spammy display ads.

“Sponsor a franchise” → let communities fund their own hosting.

The key is: DO NOT act like Fandom (Google Ads spam everywhere).

🚀 Phase 1 Gameplan (First 3 Months):

Step	Outcome
Pick one franchise to seed	Focused audience, better chance of success
Build MVP wiki with Sanity + Next.js (or whatever stack)	Fast, clean, modern experience
Import a small set of initial pages (manually if needed)	Prove concept, early content
Offer export + migration tooling (even basic)	Signal “we don’t lock you in”
Open contributor invite system	Seed early editor base
Enable donations / Patreon-style support	Validate funding model early
🥩 Optional Expansion:
Let contributors create new wikis for other franchises once the first community is happy.

Offer federation-style navigation:
“Jump from Alien to Predator to Fallout seamlessly.”

💡 Example Slogan / Pitchline Ideas:
“Wikis for fans, not clicks.”

“Escape the ad farm.”

“The clean alternative to Fandom.”

“Your lore, your rules.”
